# CUDARayTracer
Project to optimize the CUDA ray tracer found in https://github.com/xkevio/CUDA-Raytracer.

Iterations of optimizations has been split up into different directories in numerical order to allow for simple comparisons, these being src followed by a number and a name. However, srcVec3f and srcFloat3 are used by multiple iterations.
